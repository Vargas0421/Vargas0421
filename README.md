### 🏛 Frontend Development
I have experience in frontend development using modern web technologies, including:
- **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** for building interactive, responsive, and accessible web interfaces.  
- **Bootstrap** for developing mobile-friendly layouts with reusable and consistent UI components.  
- **React** for building dynamic, high-performance single-page applications.  
- **UI/UX best practices**, ensuring intuitive navigation, accessibility, and a smooth user experience.  
I prioritize writing **clean, maintainable, and scalable code**, and apply design patterns such as **MVC** to maintain a clear separation of concerns throughout the development process.

### 🏡 Backend Development
My backend development expertise includes:
- **Client-server architecture**, especially in **Java**, with a **dedicated server** handling multiple **concurrent clients** through **multithreading**.  
- **Socket programming** for secure and efficient communication between clients and servers.  
- **Backend and frontend integration in PHP**, including building dynamic web applications with shared logic.  
- **AJAX-based API consumption in PHP**, enabling seamless and responsive communication between the client and backend.  
- **RESTful API development** to connect frontend interfaces with backend services effectively.

### 🌆 Database Experience
I have extensive hands-on experience with **SQL-based databases**, including **MySQL**, **PostgreSQL**, **SQL Server**, and **Oracle SQL Developer**, focusing on:
- **Relational database design** with strong emphasis on **normalization** (1NF, 2NF, 3NF) to ensure data integrity and reduce redundancy.  
- **Query optimization and indexing strategies** to enhance performance with large-scale datasets.  
- **Stored procedures, triggers, and cursors** for automating and controlling complex database operations.  
- **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes**, particularly for structured data integration and transformation.  
- **Data serialization** using **JSON format** (e.g., with **Gson** in Java applications).  
- **Business intelligence and reporting** through tools like **Power BI** and **Pentaho**, including the creation of interactive dashboards and data-driven reports.
